# N.E.A.T (Neuroevolution of autogmented topologies)

This is an attempt at creating an artificial neural network trained using evolution strategies.
Here, the structure of the network also part of the evolution process.
Thus, the network starts with simple connections between inputs and outputs but can become more complex over generations.
